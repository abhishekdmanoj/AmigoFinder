            The main purpose of the AmigoFinder app is to enable people, mainly students, to settle into a foreign country more easily by connecting them with individuals who speak their same language in their city. This allows them to overcome language and cultural barriers more easily by enabling communication in their native language. In turn, this encourages more students to pursue studies abroad or cross country.
        </p>

            AmigoFinder aims to eliminate linguistic and cultural barriers as reasons for students to miss out on education and experience. The app is also useful for travelers who are just visiting for leisure, reducing the possibility of people getting scammed by locals through communication with someone familiar with life in the country.

            In exchange, helpers earn points for their assistance, which they can redeem for various rewards from our in-app store. It's a win-win.
